Many vector diffraction problems can be formulated in this way, and the classical results are usually the consequence of a stationary-phase approximation to the resulting integrals. For situations in which the approximation does not apply, a factorization technique is developed that substantially reduces the required computational resources. Numerical computations are based on the fast-Fourier-transform algorithm, and the practicality of this method is shown with several examples.},

Direct numerical integration takes O(N2) time, where N is the number of samples. Designing fast and accurate algorithms that take O(NlogN){\$}{\$}O(N{\backslash}log N){\$}{\$}time is of importance for practical utilization of LCTs. There are several approaches to designing fast algorithms. One approach is to decompose an arbitrary LCT into blocks, all of which have fast implementations, thus obtaining an overall fast algorithm. Another approach is to define a discrete LCT (DLCT), based on which a fast LCT (FLCT) is derived to efficiently compute LCTs. This strategy is similar to that employed for the Fourier transform, where one defines the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which is then computed with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). A third, hybrid approach involves a DLCT but employs a decomposition-based method to compute it. Algorithms for two-dimensional and complex parametered LCTs are also discussed.",

How to handle and obtain the linear canonical frequency spectrum of very large input data based on equipment with limited memory space is one of the key problems. To focus on this problem, a new kind of segmented fast linear canonical transform has been proposed in this paper. First, the large data is segmented into short data. Thereby, the proposed algorithms can calculate very large input data and simultaneously keep the ideal frequency resolution. Second, the complexity of the derived algorithms has been analyzed in detail for different kinds of signals. Their performance with regard to resolution and precision are compared with the existing fast linear canonical transforms. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the correctness of the results obtained.},
